            The Maine Homestead almost a trope in this much documented time of technology holds a future that I strive for, which is why in June 2019 a friend and I purchased 16 acres of timber forest in a small coastal town in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WjisatemwwF1NFBe7">Machias</a>, Maine for the cost of 11500$, which split would left us each with a bill of around 6000$. Daunting, yet exciting was the first season on the land. There was plenty to do, and yet that year, I did not make it up there besides one week. I knew I needed to make money before I could do anything off-grid as I thought it may it could be. My landmate Chris whom I purchased the land with, decided to go live immediately up on the land out of an early 2000s Chevy Astro Van with his partner Em, and her dog Shoba.

            The job that I decided to give a try with was in construction. I hadn't worked doing construction since I was a teenager with my uncle in smooth, summer afternoons. My base proved to be sufficient and I was quickly hired on at a company remodeling a building in my neighborhood in West Philly. I started work in March 2019, and worked solidly to the beginning of Covid in the early months of 2020. The state government of PA, shut down construction not all the way at first, but a few months into 2020. What better opportunity to go spend a summer on the land and get started.

            I made it up there early June and got exploring. When you first take some steps through a forest and think of ownership of a tree, or moss, or a small stream, a strange feeling of freeness comes over you. To see a hole in a wolf tree, where a porcupine lives, or to see frogs waiting patiently for you to pass along the edge of the water brings memories of the infinite curiosities of nature that some of us were able to investigate as children. Strange and foreign was the idea of owning an environment which brings out this connection to aeons of times past, the forest falling and regrowing 1000s of times over and a person walking through this time capsule. This need as a child, started to unravel itself inside me and I could feel myself spreading over our small plot of land.

            There was so much exploring to do. Like on Cutler trail.
